# Project - Attendance Using Face Recognition

This project is done as per the Industrial training held in our college on 2022, the title of our project is "Attendance Using Face Recognition".
Our code basically stores some images in one of our folder whose path is provided in the code, when we run the code the web cam is turned automatically, if the face shown in the webcam mathches to the image present in our database, the person is marked in the excel sheet.

Our code is very dynamic in nature, the names of the candidates are automatically reflected to the excel sheet, the names are taken from the image name automacically, one more good thing about our code is new register is created every day and the previous attendance is stored in the same excel file, no file is overwritten during the process when new data is inserted.

If you want to create a new attendance sheet from the begining, you can delete the "Attendance_Final" file and create  the file with the same name, you also need to make some changes in the "Extra_Data.csv" file you can set the data to "Yesterday's_Data,A,B,3" to get a totally new attendance register.

Yet this project can be made more awesome by adding a iris scanner to take the actual biometric of the candidate, this will reduce the chance of false attendace marking.

There are some bugs in our code to, like someone can be marked present by just showing their photo, and if a person's image is not present in our database then there is a high chance that the person will make somebody else present, well all these bugs can be removed by using an iris scanner.
